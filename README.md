# Code Challenge
Code challenge for OIT role: converting roman numerals to numbers and vice versa

# Progress
Unfortunately I did not finish in time. My plan was to take the number, break it up into pieces (e.g. 989 = [900, 80, 9]) then break it into more pieces (e.g. [900, 80, 9] = [[100, 1000], [50, 10, 10, 10], [1, 10]]). After breaking it all up, these numbers translate perfectly to what 989 would be in roman numerals: CMLXXXIX (100 corresponds to C, 1000 to M, 50 to L and so on).
